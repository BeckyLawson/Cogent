# Cogent
This is a three part tutorial that takes you from the absolute basics (e.g. how to structure a task script, how to display one single image), up to your first full experiment with audio and visual stimuli, randomisation, response logging and RT calculation etc. The third part is for people who want to learn how to do more advanced things in Cogent Graphics.

Check out the PowerPoint sides first, and follow along with the code examples.
